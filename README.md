Low-cost Arduino-based automatic water restriction for animal cages

Water restriction is an important variable that must be carefully controlled in animal experiments. In this study, we developed a low-cost device that automatically lifts a water bottle at a specified time, aiming to improve experimental efficiency and reduce labor. By using an Arduino microcontroller in combination with a relay module and an RTC (real-time clock) module, we implemented a mechanism to activate a linear actuator and lift the water bottle on schedule. To stabilize the bottle's position, we also designed a custom support structure using a 3D printer.
